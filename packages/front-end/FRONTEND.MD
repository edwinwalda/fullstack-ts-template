# Front End

## Installed:

- `vite.js`, a much faster react tooling platform, as a replacement for Create-React-App

### Design

- Adobe's `leonardo-contrast-colors` for accessable, apaptable color palettes
- Chakra UI as a solid, default design system
- - Chakra's styling is `emotion`
- - Chakra's motion library is `framer-motion`
- `dnd-kit` as our drag and drop library

### State Management

- I'm experimenting with mobx-state-tree for strongly typed, reactive state. Can always be removed to just use `mobx` and `mobx-react-lite`

### Misc

- `react-helmet-async` for page titles
- `react-router-dom` for navigation
